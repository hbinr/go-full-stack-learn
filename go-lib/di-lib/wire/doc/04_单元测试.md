## Mocking
There are two approaches for creating an injected app with mocked dependencies. Examples of both approaches are shown here.

[test_here](https://github.com/google/wire/tree/master/internal/wire/testdata/ExampleWithMocks/foo)

## Approach A: Pass mocks to the injector
Create a test-only injector that takes all of the mocks as arguments; the argument types must be the interface types the mocks are mocking. wire.Build can't include providers for the mocked dependencies without creating conflicts, so if you're using provider set(s) you will need to define one that doesn't include the mocked types.

## Approach B: Return the mocks from the injector
Create a new struct that includes the app plus all of the dependencies you want to mock. Create a test-only injector that returns this struct, give it providers for the concrete mock types, and use wire.Bind to tell Wire that the concrete mock types should be used to fulfill the appropriate interface.
