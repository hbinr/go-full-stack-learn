# Introducing Clean Architecture by refactoring a Go project  通过重构go项目介绍整洁架构

原文地址: https://threedots.tech/post/introducing-clean-architecture/

The authors of [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) dedicate a whole chapter to software architecture and how it affects development performance. One thing that often comes up is designing applications to be “loosely coupled”.
Accelerate的作者用了整整一章的篇幅来介绍软件体系结构及其对开发性能的影响。经常出现的一件事是将应用程序设计为“松散耦合”。

> The goal is for your architecture to support the ability of teams to get their work done—from design through to deployment—without requiring high-bandwidth communication between teams.
> 你架构的目标是支持团队完成工作(从设计到部署)的能力，而不需要团队之间的频繁沟通、交流。

> [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/)

If you haven’t read Accelerate yet, I highly recommend it. The book presents scientific evidence on methods leading to high performance in development teams. The approach I describe is not only based on our experiences but also mentioned throughout the book.
如果你还没有读过Accelerate，我强烈推荐它。这本书提供了有关在开发团队中实现高绩效的方法的科学证据。我描述的方法不仅基于我们的经验，而且贯穿整本书。

While coupling seems mostly related to microservices across multiple teams, we find loosely coupled architecture just as useful for work within a team. Keeping architecture standards makes parallel work possible and helps onboard new team members.
虽然耦合似乎主要与跨多个团队的微服务相关，但我们发现松耦合的体系结构对于团队内的工作同样有用。保持架构标准使并行工作成为可能，并有助于新团队成员的加入。

You probably heard about the “low coupling, high cohesion” concept, but it’s rarely obvious how to achieve it. The good news is, it’s the main benefit of Clean Architecture.
您可能听说过“低耦合、高内聚”的概念，但是很难清楚地知道如何实现它。好消息是，这是整洁架构的主要好处。

The pattern is not only an excellent way to start a project but also helpful when refactoring a poorly designed application. I focus on the latter in this post. I show refactoring of a real application, so it should be clear how to apply similar changes in your projects.
整洁架构图模式不仅是启动项目的一种很好的方式，而且在重构设计不佳的应用程序时也很有帮助。在这篇文章中，我关注的是后者。我展示了一个真实应用程序的重构，因此应该清楚如何在您的项目中应用类似的更改。

There are also other benefits of this approach we noticed:
- a standard structure, so it’s easy to find your way in the project,
- faster development in the long term,
- mocking dependencies becomes trivial in unit tests,
- easy switching from prototypes to proper solutions (e.g., changing in-memory storage to an SQL database).

我们注意到这种方法还有其他好处：
- 标准项目结构，你很容易基于此结构来找到适合你的项目分层
- 长远来看，可以更快的发展
- mock依赖关系在单元测试中变得微不足道，
- 轻松从原型切换到合适的解决方案(例如，将内存存储更改为SQL数据库)。

## 整洁结构 Clean Architecture  
I had a hard time coming up with this post’s title because the pattern comes in many flavors. There’s [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), [Onion Architecture](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/), [Hexagonal Architecture](https://web.archive.org/web/20180822100852/http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture), and Ports and Adapters.
我费了好大劲才想出这个帖子的标题，因为这个模式有很多种类型。有整洁架构、洋葱架构、六角形架构、端口和适配器。

We tried to use these patterns in Go in an idiomatic way during the last couple of years. It involved trying out some approaches, failing, changing them, and trying again.
在过去的几年里，我们试图以一种符合Go语言习惯的方式在Go中使用这些模式。尝试过一些方法，失败，改变它们，然后再尝试。

We arrived at a mix of the ideas above, sometimes not strictly following the original patterns, but we found it works well in Go. I will show our approach with a refactoring of Wild Workouts, our example application.
我们综合了上面(多个架构模式)的想法，有时并不严格遵循最初的模式，但我们发现它在Go中运行得很好。我将通过重构`Wild Workouts`(我们的示例应用程序)来展示我们的想法。

I want to point out that the idea is not new at all. A big part of it is **abstracting away implementation details**, a standard in technology, especially software.
我想指出，这个想法一点也不新鲜。其中很大一部分是**抽象出实现细节**，这是技术标准，尤其是软件标准。

Another name for it **is separation of concerns**. The concept is so old now it exists on several levels. There are structures, namespaces, modules, packages, and even (micro)services. All meant to keep related things within a boundary. Sometimes, it feels like common sense:
- If you have to optimize an SQL query, you don’t want to risk changing the display format.
- If you change an HTTP response format, you don’t want to alter the database schema.
  
它的另一个名字是**关注点分离**。这个概念太老了，现在它存在于几个层面上，如结构体、命名空间、模块、包，甚至(微)服务。所有这些都是为了将相关的事情控制在一个范围内。有时候，这感觉像是常识：
- 如果您必须优化SQL查询，您不会想要冒险更改显示格式。
- 如果更改HTTP响应格式，则不希望更改数据库架构。
  
**Our approach to Clean Architecture is two ideas combined**: separating Ports and Adapters and limiting how code structures refer to each other.
**我们的整洁架构方法是以上两个想法(定义抽象(接口)+关注点分离)的结合**：分离端口和适配器，并限制代码结构相互引用的方式。
## 在我们开始之前 Before We Start 
Before introducing Clean Architecture in Wild Workouts, I refactored the project a bit. The changes come from patterns we shared in previous posts.

在介绍Wild Workouts的Clean Architecture之前，我对项目进行了一些重构。这些变化来自于我们在以前的文章中分享的模式。

The first one is using **separate models for database entities and HTTP responses**. I’ve introduced changes in the `users` service in [my post on the DRY principle](https://threedots.tech/post/things-to-know-about-dry/). I applied the same pattern now in trainer and trainings as well. See the [full commit on GitHub](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/commit/e48fbc3d2324da887415bd91918d5e46ebfd5baf).

第一个是为数据库实体和HTTP响应使用单独的模型。我在关于DRY原则的文章中已经介绍了用户服务的变化。我现在在培训师和培训中也应用了同样的模式。请看GitHub上的完整提交。

The second change follows **the Repository Pattern** that Robert introduced in the previous article. [My refactoring](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/commit/f89da08cc3c1c7ed8e7767415b04e87d3a5ef9cf) moved database-related code in trainings to a separate structure.

第二个变化是遵循Robert在上一篇文章中介绍的Repository模式。我的重构将培训中与数据库相关的代码移到一个单独的结构中。
## Separating Ports and Adapters
Ports and Adapters can be called different names, like interfaces and infrastructure. At the core, the idea is to explicitly separate these two categories from the rest of your application code.

`Ports`和`Adapters`可以称为不同的名称，如`interfaces`和`infrastructure`。其核心思想是**显式地将这两个类别与应用程序代码的其余部分分开**。

We take the code in these groups and place it in different packages. We refer to them as “layers”. **The layers we usually use are adapters, ports, application, and domain.**

- **An adapter is how your application talks to the external world**. You have to **adapt** your internal structures to what the external API expects. Think SQL queries, HTTP or gRPC clients, file readers and writers, Pub/Sub message publishers.
- **A port is an input to your application**, and the only way the external world can reach it. It could be an HTTP or gRPC server, a CLI command, or a Pub/Sub message subscriber.
- **The application logic** is a thin layer that “glues together” other layers. It’s also known as “use cases”. If you read this code and can’t tell what database it uses or what URL it calls, it’s a good sign. Sometimes it’s very short, and that’s fine. Think about it as an orchestrator.
- If you also follow [Domain-Driven Design](https://threedots.tech/post/ddd-lite-in-go-introduction/), you can introduce **a domain layer that holds just the business logic**.

我们对代码进行了分层管理，放置在了不同的层中。**我们通常使用的层有 `ports`、`adapters`、`application`、`domain`**：
- `adapters`: 适配器是你的应用程序如何与外部世界对话。你必须使你的内部结构适应外部API所期望的东西。想象一下 SQL 查询、HTTP 或 gRPC 客户端、文件读写器、Pub/Sub 消息发布器。
- `ports`: 端口是你的应用程序的输入，也是外部世界能够到达它的唯一途径。它可能是一个HTTP或gRPC服务器，一个CLI命令，或一个Pub/Sub消息订阅者。类似controller或者handler
- `application`: 应用逻辑是 "粘合 "其他层的薄层。它也被称为 "用例"。如果你读了这段代码，却无法判断它使用了什么数据库或调用了什么URL，这是个好兆头。有时它很短，这很好。把它当作一个编排器吧。
- `domain`: 如果你也遵循领域驱动设计，你可以引入一个领域层，只存放业务逻辑。

Let’s start refactoring by introducing the layers in the trainings service. The project looks like this so far:
```sh
trainings/
├── firestore.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── http.go
├── main.go
├── openapi_api.gen.go
└── openapi_types.gen.go
```

This part of refactoring is simple:

1. Create `ports`, `adapters`, and `app` directories.
2. Move each file to the proper directory.
```sh
trainings/
├── adapters
│   └── firestore.go
├── app
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── main.go
└── ports
    ├── http.go
    ├── openapi_api.gen.go
    └── openapi_types.gen.go
```
I introduced similar packages in the `trainer` service. We won’t make any changes to the `users` service this time. There’s no application logic there, and overall, it’s tiny. As with every technique, apply Clean Architecture where it makes sense.

> PS

> - `ports/http/hour_handler.go`.

You probably noticed there are no files in the `app` package. We now have to extract the application logic from HTTP handlers.

## The Application Layer
Let’s see where our application logic lives. Take a look at the `CancelTraining` method in the `trainings` service.
```go
func (h HttpServer) CancelTraining(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	trainingUUID := r.Context().Value("trainingUUID").(string)

	user, err := auth.UserFromCtx(r.Context())
	if err != nil {
		httperr.Unauthorised("no-user-found", err, w, r)
		return
	}

	err = h.db.CancelTraining(r.Context(), user, trainingUUID)
	if err != nil {
		httperr.InternalError("cannot-update-training", err, w, r)
		return
	}
}
```
> Full source: [github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/internal/trainings/http.go](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/blob/f89da08cc3c1c7ed8e7767415b04e87d3a5ef9cf/internal/trainings/http.go#L95)

This method is the entry point to the application. There’s not much logic there, so let’s go deeper into the `db.CancelTraining` method.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/2774323/1627006156097-c04bbb24-2337-458a-a2f2-f6473d38aca9.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fresize%2Cw_1496)

Inside the Firestore transaction, there’s a lot of code that doesn’t belong to database handling.

What’s worse, the actual application logic inside this method uses the database model (`TrainingModel`) for decision making:
```go
if training.canBeCancelled() {
	// ...
} else {
	// ...
}
```
> Full source: [github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/internal/trainings/firestore.go](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/blob/f89da08cc3c1c7ed8e7767415b04e87d3a5ef9cf/internal/trainings/firestore.go#L133)

Mixing the business rules (like when a training can be canceled) with the database model slows down development, as the code becomes hard to understand and reason about. It’s also difficult to test such logic.

To fix this, we add an intermediate `Training` type in the `app` layer:
```go
type Training struct {
	UUID     string
	UserUUID string
	User     string

	Time  time.Time
	Notes string

	ProposedTime   *time.Time
	MoveProposedBy *string
}

func (t Training) CanBeCancelled() bool {
	return t.Time.Sub(time.Now()) > time.Hour*24
}

func (t Training) MoveRequiresAccept() bool {
	return !t.CanBeCancelled()
}
```
> Full source: [github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/internal/trainings/app/training.go](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/blob/e98630507809492b16496f4370dd26b1d26220d3/internal/trainings/app/training.go#L5)

It should now be clear on the first read when a training can be canceled. We can’t tell how the training is stored in the database or the JSON format used in the HTTP API. That’s a good sign.

We can now update the database layer methods to return this generic application type instead of the database-specific structure (`TrainingModel`). The mapping is trivial because the structs have the same fields (but from now on, they can evolve independently from each other).
```go
t := TrainingModel{}
if err := doc.DataTo(&t); err != nil {
	return nil, err
}

trainings = append(trainings, app.Training(t))
```

## The Application Service
We then create a `TrainingsService` struct in the `app` package that will serve as the entry point to trainings application logic.
```go
type TrainingService struct {
}

func (c TrainingService) CancelTraining(ctx context.Context, user auth.User, trainingUUID string) error {

}
```
So how do we call the database now? Let’s try to replicate what was used so far in the HTTP handler.
```go
type TrainingService struct {
	db adapters.DB
}

func (c TrainingService) CancelTraining(ctx context.Context, user auth.User, trainingUUID string) error {
	return c.db.CancelTraining(ctx, user, trainingUUID)
}
```

This code won’t compile, though.
```go
import cycle not allowed
package github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/internal/trainings
        imports github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/internal/trainings/adapters
        imports github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/internal/trainings/app
        imports github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/internal/trainings/adapters
```
We need to **decide how the layers should refer to each other.**
## The Dependency Inversion Principle
A clear separation between ports, adapters, and application logic is useful by itself. Clean Architecture improves it further with Dependency Inversion.

The rule states that **outer layers (implementation details) can refer to inner layers (abstractions), but not the other way around**. The inner layers should instead depend on interfaces.
- The **Domain** knows nothing about other layers whatsoever. It contains pure business logic.
- The **Application** can import domain but knows nothing about outer layers. **It has no idea whether it’s being called by an HTTP request, a Pub/Sub handler, or a CLI command.**
- **Ports** can import inner layers. Ports are the entry points to the application, so they often execute application services or commands. However, they can’t directly access **Adapters**.
- **Adapters** can import inner layers. Usually, they will operate on types found in **Application** and **Domain**, for example, retrieving them from the database.

![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/2774323/1627006563986-1331c966-2561-4b76-a446-16cc9e5b9e4b.png?x-oss-process=image%2Fresize%2Cw_1496)

Again, it’s not a new idea. **The Dependency Inversion Principle is the “D” in [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)**. Do you think it applies only to OOP? It just happens that [Go interfaces make a perfect match with it](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/08/20/solid-go-design).

The principle solves the issue of how packages should refer to each other. The best way to do it is rarely obvious, especially in Go, where import cycles are forbidden. Perhaps that’s why some developers claim it’s best to avoid “nesting” and keep all code in one package. **But packages exist for a reason, and that’s separation of concerns.**

Going back to our example, how should we refer to the database layer?

Going back to our example, how should we refer to the database layer?

Because the Go interfaces don’t need to be explicitly implemented, **we can define them next to the code that needs them**.

define them next to the code that needs them.

So the application service defines: 
>“I need a way to cancel a training with given UUID. I don’t care how you do it, but I trust you to do it right if you implement this interface”.

```go
type trainingRepository interface {
	CancelTraining(ctx context.Context, user auth.User, trainingUUID string) error
}

type TrainingService struct {
	trainingRepository trainingRepository
}

func (c TrainingService) CancelTraining(ctx context.Context, user auth.User, trainingUUID string) error {
	return c.trainingRepository.CancelTraining(ctx, user, trainingUUID)
}
```
> Full source: [github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/internal/trainings/app/training_service.go](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/blob/e98630507809492b16496f4370dd26b1d26220d3/internal/trainings/app/training_service.go#L13)

The database method calls gRPC clients of `trainer` and `users` services. It’s not the proper place, so we introduce two new interfaces that the service will use.

```go
type userService interface {
	UpdateTrainingBalance(ctx context.Context, userID string, amountChange int) error
}

type trainerService interface {
	ScheduleTraining(ctx context.Context, trainingTime time.Time) error
	CancelTraining(ctx context.Context, trainingTime time.Time) error
}
```

> **Note** that “user” and “trainer” in this context are not microservices, but application (business) concepts. It just happens that in this project, they live in the scope of microservices with the same names.

We move implementations of these interfaces to adapters as [UsersGrpc](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/blob/e98630507809492b16496f4370dd26b1d26220d3/internal/trainings/adapters/users_grpc.go#L9) and [TrainerGrpc](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/blob/e98630507809492b16496f4370dd26b1d26220d3/internal/trainings/adapters/trainer_grpc.go#L13). As a bonus, the timestamp conversion now happens there as well, invisible to the application service.

### Extracting the Application Logic
The code compiles, but our application service doesn’t do much yet. Now is the time to extract the logic and put it in the proper place.

Finally, we can use the update function pattern from [the Repositories post repository 文章](https://threedots.tech/post/repository-pattern-in-go/) to extract the application logic out of the repository.
```go
func (c TrainingService) CancelTraining(ctx context.Context, user auth.User, trainingUUID string) error {
	return c.repo.CancelTraining(ctx, trainingUUID, func(training Training) error {
		if user.Role != "trainer" && training.UserUUID != user.UUID {
			return errors.Errorf("user '%s' is trying to cancel training of user '%s'", user.UUID, training.UserUUID)
		}

		var trainingBalanceDelta int
		if training.CanBeCancelled() {
			// just give training back
			trainingBalanceDelta = 1
		} else {
			if user.Role == "trainer" {
				// 1 for cancelled training +1 fine for cancelling by trainer less than 24h before training
				trainingBalanceDelta = 2
			} else {
				// fine for cancelling less than 24h before training
				trainingBalanceDelta = 0
			}
		}

		if trainingBalanceDelta != 0 {
			err := c.userService.UpdateTrainingBalance(ctx, training.UserUUID, trainingBalanceDelta)
			if err != nil {
				return errors.Wrap(err, "unable to change trainings balance")
			}
		}

		err := c.trainerService.CancelTraining(ctx, training.Time)
		if err != nil {
			return errors.Wrap(err, "unable to cancel training")
		}

		return nil
	})
}
```

The amount of logic suggests we might want to introduce a domain layer sometime in the future. For now, let’s keep it as it is.

I described the process for just a single CancelTraining method. Refer to the [full diff](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example/commit/e98630507809492b16496f4370dd26b1d26220d3) to see how I refactored all other methods.

### Dependency Injection
How to tell the service which adapter to use? First, we define a simple constructor for the service.

```go
func NewTrainingsService(
	repo trainingRepository,
	trainerService trainerService,
	userService userService,
) TrainingService {
	if repo == nil {
		panic("missing trainingRepository")
	}
	if trainerService == nil {
		panic("missing trainerService")
	}
	if userService == nil {
		panic("missing userService")
	}

	return TrainingService{
		repo:           repo,
		trainerService: trainerService,
		userService:    userService,
	}
}
```
